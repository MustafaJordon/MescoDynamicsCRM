The Carrier shall be under no obligation to take any steps whatsoever&#13;&#10;to collect security for General Average contributions due to the Merchant.&#13;&#10;16. CHARGES&#13;&#10;Charges shall be deemed fully earned on receipt of the Goods by the Carrier and shall&#13;&#10;be paid and non-returnable in any event.&#13;&#10;The Charges have been calculated on the basis of particulars furnished by or on behalf&#13;&#10;of the Merchant.

Despite the acceptance by the Carrier of instructions to collect freight,&#13;&#10;charges or other expenses from any other person in respect of the transport under this&#13;&#10;bill of lading, the Merchant shall remain responsible for such monies on receipt of&#13;&#10;evidence of demand and the absence of payment for whatever reason. 17.

VARIATION OF THE CONTRACT&#13;&#10;No servant or agent of the Carrier shall have power to waive or vary any of the terms&#13;&#10;hereof unless such waiver or variation is in writing and is specifically authorized or&#13;&#10;ratified in writing by a director or officer of the Carrier who has the actual authority of&#13;&#10;the Carrier to waive or vary.&#13;&#10;19. PARTIAL INVALIDITY&#13;&#10;If any provision in this bill of lading is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any Court&#13;&#10;or regulatory or self-regulatory agency or body, such invalidity or unenforceability shall&#13;&#10;attach only to such provision. The validity of the remaining provisions shall not be&#13;&#10;affected thereby and this bill of lading contract shall be carried out as if such invalid or&#13;&#10;unenforceable provision were not contained herein.&#13;&#10;20. JURISDICTION AND LAW&#13;&#10;This bill of lading shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English Law.

The Merchant shall Indemnify the Carrier against any&#13;&#10;claim or liability (and any expense arising therefrom) arising from the Carriage of the&#13;&#10;Goods insofar as such claim or liability exceeds the Carrier’s liability under this bill of&#13;&#10;lading.&#13;&#10;The defences and limits of liability provided for in this bill of lading shall apply in any&#13;&#10;action against the Carrier whether the action is found in contract, bailment, tort, or&#13;&#10;breach of express or implied warranty or otherwise.&#13;&#10;6. CARRIER’S RESPONSIBILITY&#13;&#10;(1) PORT TO PORT SHIPMENT&#13;&#10;(A) Where the Carriage is Port to Port, then the liability (if any) of the Carrier for loss or&#13;&#10;damage to the Goods occurring between the time of loading at the Port of Loading and&#13;&#10;the time of discharge at the Port of Delivery shall be determined in accordance with&#13;&#10;any national law making the Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules, COGSA or any other rules&#13;&#10;compulsorily applicable to this bill of lading or in any other case in accordance with the&#13;&#10;Hague Rules Article 1-8 inclusive (excluding Article 3 rule 8) only.&#13;&#10;(B) The Carrier shall be under no liability whatsoever for loss or damage to the Goods&#13;&#10;while in its actual or constructive possession before loading or after discharge,&#13;&#10;howsoever caused. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case and to the extent that any&#13;&#10;applicable compulsory law provides to the contrary, the Carrier shall have the benefit&#13;&#10;of every right, defence, limitation and liberty in the Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules,&#13;&#10;COGSA or any other rules as applied by Clause 6(1) (A) during such additional&#13;&#10;compulsory period of responsibility, notwithstanding that the loss or damage did not&#13;&#10;occur at sea.&#13;&#10;(C) If COGSA applies, then the provisions stated in COGSA shall govern the Carrier’s&#13;&#10;liability throughout the Carriage by sea and the entire time that the Goods are in the&#13;&#10;actual custody of the Carrier or his Sub-Contractor at the container yard, freight station&#13;&#10;or area immediately adjacent to the sea terminal before loading onto the vessel or&#13;&#10;after discharge therefrom as the case may be. Where the Merchant requests the&#13;&#10;Carrier to procure Carriage by an inland Carrier in the United States of America, such&#13;&#10;carriage shall be procured by the Carrier as agent only to the Merchant and such&#13;&#10;carriage shall be subject to the inland Carrier’s contract tariff. If, for any reason, the&#13;&#10;Carrier is denied the right to act as agent only at these times, his liability for loss,&#13;&#10;damage or delay to the Goods shall be determined in accordance with Clause 6(2)&#13;&#10;hereof.&#13;&#10;(D) If the Goods are discharged at a Port other than the Port of Discharge or (save in&#13;&#10;the United States of America) at a Place of Delivery instead of the Port of Discharge,&#13;&#10;and the Carrier in its absolute discretion agrees to a request to such effect, such&#13;&#10;further Carriage will be undertaken on the basis that the Terms and Conditions are to&#13;&#10;apply to such Carriage as if the ultimate destination agreed with the Merchant had&#13;&#10;been entered on the reverse side of this bill of lading as the Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery.&#13;&#10;" Font="Arial, 4pt"/>
